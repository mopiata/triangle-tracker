# Triangle Tracker

## Description
This is a program that allows users to enter three values each representing the length of a side of a possible triangle. The program checks the values and evaluates if they will form a scalene, isoceles, equilateral or no triangle at all. Below are specifications and sample inputs and outputs to explain the program's expected behaviour:

##Specifications of how it should work
  ###program returns equilateral triangle if a user enters all equal lengths
      Example input:7,7,7
      Example output: "This will form an equilateral triangle"
  ###program returns isoceles triangle if a user enters two equal lengths
      Example input:7,7,6
      Example output: "This will form an isoceles triangle"
  ###program returns scalene triangle if a user enters all unequal lengths
      Example input:3,4,5
      Example output: "This will form a scalene triangle"
  ###program returns not a triangle if sum of any two sides is equal to a third
      Example input:7,3,4
      Example output: "This will not form a triangle"
  ###program returns not a triangle if sum of any two sides is less than a third
      Example input:3,4,100
      Example output: "This will not form a triangle"
  ###program returns error if no values are entered
      Example input: ,,,
      Example output: "This field is required"
  ###program returns error if non numerical numbers are entered
      Example input: c,r,b
      Example output: "You must enter numerical values"


## Getting started
This is a one page portfolio. It includes different sections i.e. About Me, Projects and Contacts. You can navigate to the different sections by scrolling or using the menu items at the top of the page. Each section gives relevant information about me. One link (Blog) is inactive and I hope to bring it up soon where I can share about different areas of interest for me.

### Built With
